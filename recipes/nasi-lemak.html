    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Cooking the rice</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you have a rice cooker, life couldn’t be any easier, just put everything in the rice cooker and press the cook button. Wait 10 minutes before opening the lid to fluff the rice</li>
        <li>If you don’t own one, use a heavy-bottom pot. Bring the water, coconut milk, pandan leaves, and lemongrass to a boil and then add the rice. Bring it back to a gentle simmer and then close the lid. Cook for 5 minutes and then give it a stir to prevent coconut milk from catching. Close the lid back and cook for another 5 minutes. Turn off the heat. Wait 10 minutes before opening the lid to fluff the rice</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Fried anchovies</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a medium-size pan with 1 tsp cooking oil. Add anchovies and pan fry until crispy. Add a small pinch of salt and sugar and dish out. In the same pan, add another 1 tsp of oil. Add the peanuts and cook until the peanuts are lightly brown. Add a pinch of sugar and salt. Turn off the heat and give it a good stir to mix everything. Remove from the heat</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>When ready to serve</h3>
