    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons peanut oil or coconut oil</li>
        <li>1–2 (7-ounce) jars of store-bought Laksa Paste</li>
        <li>6 cups chicken stock or broth</li>
        <li>8 lime leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar or palm sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds raw chicken (breast or thigh meat) cut into thin, bite-sized pieces (or sub fish or crispy tofu)</li>
        <li>1 pound raw large shrimp (raw, peeled, or sub firm fish, or more chicken or veggies )</li>
        <li>2 x 13.5–ounce cans full-fat coconut milk. <strong>Do not use “lite”</strong> – and if you like an even richer broth, add a third can.</li>
        <li>Juice from 1–2 limes</li>
        <li>fish sauce to taste ( I use 1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>1 pound dry rice noodles (2 ounces per person) (or 1 1/2 – 2 lbs <em>fresh</em> rice noodles from the refrigerated section of the Asian market).</li>
        <li><strong>Garnishes:</strong>bean sprouts, lime wedges, cilantro, Vietnamese mint, scallions, sambal chili paste, fried shallots (available in jars at an Asian market)</li>
        <li><strong>OPTIONAL ADDITIONS or Substitutions:</strong> Fried tofu cubes, fish balls ( frozen), scallops or other firm fish, clams, mussels, and veggies like snow peas, mushrooms, carrots, bell pepper, chopped spinach or greens etc….</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook rice noodles according to directions. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large heavy-bottom soup pot or dutch oven, heat  3 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add all the homemade Laksa Paste  (or the 7-ounce Jar), and saute, stirring constantly until it becomes very fragrant and deep in color about 2-3 minutes. (Turn stove fan on- it will smell strong- don’t worry.). Add the chicken broth, scraping up all the brown bits.  Add the lime leaves, salt and sugar and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and simmer 4-5 minutes. Add shrimp, cook for 2-3 minutes, add coconut milk. Simmer until heated through. Do not boil this too long or you will lose the lovely sweetness from the coconut milk– just gently warm.</li>
        <li>Add lime juice, starting with a 1 lime, and add more to taste. Add fish sauce to taste, adding a teaspoon at a time. The broth should taste rich and deep, and slightly salty (the noodles will mellow the salt out) and just a little limey. If it tastes, too “fishy” add more lime juice. Guests can squeeze more lime to taste. If you want more heat, add chili flakes or chili paste.</li>
        <li>Divide the cooked rice noodles among bowls. Ladle flavorful soup over top of noodles. Top bowls with a handful of fresh bean sprouts, fresh cilantro and/or mint.  Serve with chili sauce and lime wedges.</li>
        <li>For rice noodles, calculate two ounces ( dry rice noodles ) per person.</li>
    </ol>
